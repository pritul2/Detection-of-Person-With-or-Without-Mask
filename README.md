In this lock down situation, we decided to represent our idea on Personal Hygiene which is a contribution from our side to this pandemic of corona virus.

So, we have proposed AI based prototype in which we are detecting whether a Person has worn a Mask or not. Generally in shopping malls or near grocery shops or areas where the large group of people coming then it is difficult to monitor whether the person is wearing a mask or not. Also nowadays our government had made compulsory wear a mask else penalty is considered, then in that situation, our application will classify and tell whether the person had worn a mask or not and will make alert for an administrator.
